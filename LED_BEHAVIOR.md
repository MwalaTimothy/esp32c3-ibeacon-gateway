# LED Status Indicator System

## Overview
The ESP32-C3 uses an RGB LED on GPIO 7 to indicate the system's operational status with solid colors (no blinking).

## LED Color States

### ðŸ”´ RED (Solid)
- **Status**: Unconfigured or Connection Issues
- **Meaning**: Device is not connected to WiFi OR BLE initialization failed
- **Action Required**: Configure WiFi credentials via web interface or check BLE functionality

### ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW (Solid)
- **Status**: Partially Configured
- **Meaning**: WiFi connected and BLE working, but missing server URL configuration
- **Action Required**: Complete table configuration via web interface

### ðŸŸ¢ GREEN (Solid)
- **Status**: Fully Configured and Operational
- **Meaning**: WiFi connected, BLE active, and server URL configured
- **Action Required**: None - system ready for pizza ordering

## Technical Implementation

### Color Generation
- **Red**: RGB(255, 0, 0)
- **Yellow**: RGB(255, 255, 0) - simulated on RGB LED
- **Green**: RGB(0, 255, 0)

### Status Check Logic
```cpp
bool isFullyConfigured = (wifiConnected && bleInitialized && serverURL.length() > 0);
bool isWiFiConnected = wifiConnected && bleInitialized;
```

### Update Frequency
- LED status is checked and updated continuously in the main loop
- No blinking or timing delays - immediate status reflection
- Status changes are logged to serial output for debugging

## Troubleshooting

### LED stuck on RED:
- Check WiFi credentials
- Verify router connectivity
- Check BLE initialization in serial monitor

### LED stuck on YELLOW:
- Access web interface at device IP
- Complete table configuration
- Verify server URL is set

### LED not lighting:
- Check GPIO 7 connection
- Verify LED hardware
- Check power supply

## Recent Changes
- **Version 2.0**: Removed blinking behavior per user request
- **Improvement**: Solid color indication for better visibility in restaurant environment
- **Enhancement**: Clear status differentiation between configuration states
