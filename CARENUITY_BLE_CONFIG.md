# Carenuity Restaurant BLE Configuration

## Changes Made

### **✅ BLE Device Name: "Carenuity Restaurant"**
- **Previous**: "SmartTable_X" (generic table names)  
- **New**: "Carenuity Restaurant" (unified restaurant branding)
- **Benefit**: Customers see consistent restaurant branding in BLE scans

### **✅ 2-Meter Range Limitation**
- **Previous**: Default ESP32 power (~10+ meter range)
- **New**: -12dBm transmission power (~2 meter range)  
- **Benefit**: Precise table detection, no cross-table interference

### **✅ No BLE Password Required** 
- **Status**: Already implemented (iBeacon standard)
- **Type**: Non-connectable advertising (ADV_TYPE_NONCONN_IND)
- **Benefit**: Instant detection without pairing or authentication

## Technical Implementation

### **Device Name Setting**
```cpp
const char* deviceName = "Carenuity Restaurant";
esp_ble_gap_set_device_name(deviceName);
```

### **2-Meter Range Configuration** 
```cpp
esp_ble_tx_power_set(ESP_BLE_PWR_TYPE_ADV, ESP_PWR_LVL_N12);
// -12dBm = approximately 2 meter detection range
```

### **Password-Free Operation**
```cpp
.adv_type = ADV_TYPE_NONCONN_IND,  // Non-connectable = no pairing needed
.adv_filter_policy = ADV_FILTER_ALLOW_SCAN_ANY_CON_ANY,  // Open to all devices
```

## Customer Experience

### **What Customers See:**
1. **BLE Device Name**: "Carenuity Restaurant" 
2. **Detection Range**: Only when within ~2 meters of table
3. **No Password Prompt**: Instant connection to ordering system
4. **Table Identification**: Automatic via iBeacon Major/Minor values

### **Detection Behavior:**
- **Approach Table**: Phone detects "Carenuity Restaurant" beacon
- **Proximity Notification**: "Order from Carenuity Restaurant - Table X"
- **One Tap Access**: Direct to menu without any password entry
- **Leave Table**: Signal fades as customer moves >2 meters away

## Customer Instructions

### **For Restaurant Staff:**
"Customers will see 'Carenuity Restaurant' on their phones when they sit down. No setup required - they just tap the notification to order."

### **For Customers:**  
"When you sit at your table, you'll see 'Carenuity Restaurant' appear on your phone. Tap it to view our menu and place your order directly to the kitchen!"

### **Troubleshooting:**
- **Not detecting**: Customer may be >2 meters from table beacon
- **Wrong table orders**: Check that beacons aren't interfering (proper 2m spacing)
- **No notification**: Ensure customer has Bluetooth enabled

This configuration creates the perfect balance of **precise detection**, **professional branding**, and **seamless user experience** for Carenuity Restaurant's smart ordering system!
